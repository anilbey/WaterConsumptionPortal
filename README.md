# WaterConsumptionPortal

The objective of the Water Consumption portal is to provide users a web application in which they can
monitor their water consumption data in various granularity settings. Furthermore, it allow users to
compare their consumption with the consumption made in the neighborhood. Water Consumption Portal
is also providing a map view to visualize the registered users on the map.

The application uses Hibernate as an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) Framework which is an
implementation of the JPA (Java Persistence API) specification. 

Maven build automation tool is used in the project to manage the projectâ€™s build. The front-end of the
Water Consumption Portal is made responsive to various screen sizes using Bootstrap libraries. Besides
Bootstrap, the application is enriched with several front-end widgets. Google Charts API, Google Maps API
and the Google Maps Geocode API are used in the Water Consumption Portal.
